Nice to meet you! I'm currently working at Alaska Airlines as a software engineer.
I love working on new challenges and always have a side project that pushes my boundaries!
Most of the time that work is live streamed on Twitch. Feel free to join a session of code and chill ✨

## My Apps
I always push myself to finish all my side projects and release them to production 🚀
